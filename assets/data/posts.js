    content: `YES, ‘Evil’ is a strong word– especially for an activity that most of the world thinks of as ‘Good’. However, after all that I have observed, I have come to have deep doubts about Recycling’s benevolence. There is an ominous reality lurking behind it that we ignore at the peril of people and planet. Perhaps you already have your suspicions– after seeing a beach strewn with plastic, glimpsing a smouldering ‘landfill’, or hearing about a great patch of plastic in the ocean.

For those of you who have read or seen the Lord of the Rings, you will remember Saruman, the ‘White Wizard’. Everyone thought he was a good guy. Just like the characters in the story, as a kid reading the book, I was fooled too. After all, he wore a white robe, lived in a grove of oaks, and seemed concerned about the world.

But not all is as it seems.

      'And why Wordle wouldn’t work so well in languages with more complex grammars',

    content: `Why English Wordle works
    
English grammatical endings increase the length of the word, which is why Wordle can work with the word length. For example, compare the word “works” with the present ending “-s” and “worked” with the past ending “-ed”. “Works” has five letters and “worked” has six. This means that when you play, you won’t miss the word solely based on its grammatical form. You will almost always miss or guess the word based on its lexical meaning, like guessing between “work” and “pork”. Guessing between “work” and “pork” is fun, right? They mean completely different things, but they differ only in one letter.
    
Now, guessing between “works” and “worked” would not be so much fun. You already figured out the gist: The meaning of the word is “work”, yes, but who cares if it’s in the present or past tense… Well, that’s exactly what would happen if we made Wordle, with the same rules, in languages with more inflections and conjugations than English.`,
